**Employee Performance Rating Prediction Model**

---

### **Executive Summary**
This report evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict employee performance ratings (1: Low, 2: Average, 3: High) using a dataset of 1,200 records with 11 features. The best-performing model, **XGBoost**, achieved **92.5% accuracy** and demonstrated robustness in handling class imbalances and minimizing overfitting. Key findings include:
- **XGBoost** outperformed other models in accuracy, F1-score (92.4%), and ROC AUC (0.976).
- **EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction** and **EmpLastSalaryHikePercent** were the most influential features across all models.
- Ensemble methods (Voting/Stacking) showed competitive performance but were marginally outperformed by standalone XGBoost.

### **Data Overview**  

#### **Dataset Description**  
- **Size**: 1,200 employees, 12 features.  
- **Target Variable**: `PerformanceRating` (3 classes: 1=Low, 2=Average, 3=High).  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Job Satisfaction Metrics**: `EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction`, `EmpJobSatisfaction`, `EmpWorkLifeBalance`.  
  - **Experience & Tenure**: `ExperienceYearsAtThisCompany`, `TotalWorkExperienceInYears`, `YearsSinceLastPromotion`.  
  - **Compensation & Role**: `EmpLastSalaryHikePercent`, `EmpJobRole_freq`.  
  - **Work Conditions**: `OverTime`, `DistanceFromHome`.  

#### **Preprocessing**  
- **Class Mapping**: Target labels remapped to [0, 1, 2] for model compatibility.

### **Feature Importance Analysis**
| Feature                      | XGBoost | Random Forest | LightGBM | CatBoost |
|------------------------------|---------|---------------|----------|----------|
| EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction   | 0.4945  | 0.2712        | 1.2061   | 1.2638   |
| EmpLastSalaryHikePercent     | 0.3720  | 0.2990        | 1.0529   | 1.3524   |
| YearsSinceLastPromotion      | 0.2631  | 0.1229        | 0.8972   | 0.8344   |
| EmpDepartment_Development    | 0.1015  | 0.0412        | 0.3516   | 0.3827   |
| EmpWorkLifeBalance           | 0.1310  | 0.0549        | 0.3490   | 0.2972   |

**Key Insights**:  
- **EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction** and **EmpLastSalaryHikePercent** were universally critical.  
- Tree-based models (LightGBM, CatBoost) emphasized **YearsSinceLastPromotion** more than others.  
- **EmpJobRole_freq** and **TotalWorkExperienceInYears** had lower but consistent importance.

### **Discussion**
1. **Class Imbalance Handling**:  
   - Class weights improved minority class (Rating 3) recall from 77% to 87% compared to baseline models.  
   - Rating 2 (majority class) dominated predictions but was well-balanced with F1-score of 95%.  

2. **Model Robustness**:  
   - XGBoost’s shallow trees (`max_depth=3`) minimized overfitting (overfit score: 0.0083).  
   - Voting/Stacking ensembles provided stability but added computational overhead.  

3. **Limitations**:  
   - Rating 3 (highest performance) had lower recall due to limited samples (26 test instances).  
   - KNN and Naive Bayes struggled with non-linear decision boundaries.  

---

### **Recommendations**
1. **Deployment**: Use XGBoost for real-time predictions due to its speed, accuracy, and minimal overfitting.  
2. **Monitoring**: Track class distribution shifts and recalibrate weights if necessary.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Explore interactions between **EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction** and **YearsSinceLastPromotion**.

### **Conclusion**
The XGBoost model is recommended for predicting employee performance ratings, offering a balance of interpretability, accuracy, and efficiency. Its ability to generalize well, coupled with actionable feature insights, makes it a strategic tool for HR analytics. Future work should focus on expanding the dataset for underrepresented classes (e.g., Rating 3) and validating model fairness across employee subgroups.
